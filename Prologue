## Dear visitor
After arduous development and improvement in a entire semester, under the theme of the digital illustration of \
the spirits of scientists, our studio create a word adventure game from scratch named in "利剑藏锋". \
\
Based on the famous patriotic chinese scientist--Xuesen Tsien's personal experience, this game let players \
experience the events in "Two Bombs and One Satellite" Project and make strategic alternatives and alterations \
in person. When you are in these scenarios, facing the unknown, the critical options may be just in your casual \
judgement.
\
There is no assumption in history, and the success is truth. Thus, only the choices matching the history will \
lead to success, any critical mistake will doom you to failure. No matter you succeed or lose, golden spirits \
in scientists of that time will imprint in every player's bones along the way.
\
***"Imprint the historical message, inherit the spiritual heritage"*** is the game's passion and the teen's mission. \
\
Here comes our official release of "ScientistSpirits-Beta". We sincerely invite everyone to try this game and \
welcome any suggestion to make it better. We are proud to make a little contribution in ideological and political \
education. Our game is a tentative attempt in the innovation of approaches in such education.
